# Sample function of how the code is supposedly going to function
# polycarp = Account(11840)
# check if Polycarp has registered a current account
# Logic is that Having an account does not imply having current account
# We register a current account and if the same a/c number matches the a/c no for polycarp it's assigned to him
# p_current.current = Current(11840, 5000, 09/03/2017)   #Also from this object it's where we shall get checks related
# A person can have more than one current/savings/loans account
